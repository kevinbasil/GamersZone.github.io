                    <p>In the wake of the ELEAGUE Major (congratulations Astralis!), we’re making a change to the map pool: Inferno has returned to Active Duty, replacing Dust II, and will be featured at the next CS:GO Major. As in the past, the updated Active Duty pool is automatically selected when you enter Matchmaking.</p>

                    <p>And in Casual and Deathmatch game modes, it’s now a bit easier to play your favorite maps. Map groups have been separated into additional categories: Active Duty, Hostage, Reserves, and Dust II.</p>

                    <p>Congratulations to Astralis, the winners of ELEAGUE Atlanta 2017! They take home $500,000 of the $1,000,000 prize pool. This is their first Major title.

Astralis won the best of three against Virtus.Pro, winning on Overpass(16-14) and then on Train(16-14). If you missed any of the matches or want to watch the highlights, you can download all the games from the ELEAGUE Atlanta 2017 tab in the WATCH menu.

We’d like to thank all the teams, everyone at ELEAGUE , and most of all the Counter-Strike community for making this tournament possible.</p>

                    <p>As day three comes to an end, two teams have secured their spots in the playoffs. Navi and Virtus.Pro advance to the next stage unbeaten.

Tune in for day four as the remaining twelve teams fight for their chance to make it to the playoffs.

Watch the action unfold on GOTV or on Twitch. Day four gets underway at 10am EST (4:00 PM CEST).</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Dead Space</h2>

                    <p>Dead Space is a science fiction survival horror video game developed by EA Redwood Shores for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The game was released on all platforms through October 2008.</p>

                    <p>Resident Evil 4’s influence has become immeasurable since its release in 2005. Games like Gears of War and Uncharted owe much to the game that revolutionized third-person action controls. However, one popular sci-fi horror game would look a lot like an entirely different sci-fi horror game if not for Capcom’s reinvention of its seminal series. I got the opportunity to sit down with Dead Space designers Ben Wanat and Wright Bagwell to talk about the early days of development and how Resident Evil 4 helped them shape their own horror series out of another.</p>

                    <blockquote>"When Resident Evil 4 came out, we were just awestruck by it," Wanat told me. "We were all playing it and we were like, 'Holy shit, this is a really awesome game. They're actually trying to tell a story; they've got some cool cinematics; the gameplay systems are fixing a lot of problems, bringing it into this action realm but keeping this intense horror feel to it. It was this amazing combination and—oh, the enemies were so freakin' cool."</blockquote>

                    <p>Wanat didn't shy away from admitting that Resident Evil 4 is one of his favourite games of all time. And it's clear looking at Dead Space that he wasn't alone at EA Redwood Shores (now Visceral Games).</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Overwatch</h2>

                    <p>Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. It was released in May 2016 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">Soldiers. Scientists. Adventurers. Oddities. </span>

                    <p>In a time of global crisis, an international task force of heroes banded together to restore peace to a war-torn world: OVERWATCH.</p>

                    <p>Overwatch ended the crisis, and helped maintain peace in the decades that followed, inspiring an era of exploration, innovation, and discovery. But, after many years, Overwatch’s influence waned, and it was eventually disbanded.</p>

                    <p>Now, conflict is rising across the world again, and the call has gone out to heroes old and new. Are you with us?</p>
